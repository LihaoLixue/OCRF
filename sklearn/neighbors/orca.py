class Orca():
    """Unsupervised Outlier Detection using Local Outlier Factor (LOF)

    The anomaly score of each sample is called Local Outlier Factor.
    It measures the local deviation of density of a given sample with
    respect to its neighbors.
    It is local in that the degree depends on how isolated the object is
    with respect to the surrounding neighborhood.
    More precisely, locality is given by k-nearest neighbors, whose distance
    is used to estimate the local density.
    By comparing the local density of a sample to the local densities of
    its neighbors, one can identify samples that have a substantially lower
    density than their neighbors. These are considered as outliers.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_neighbors : int, optional (default = 5)
        Number of neighbors to use by default for :meth:`k_neighbors` queries.

    algorithm : {'auto', 'ball_tree', 'kd_tree', 'brute'}, optional
        Algorithm used to compute the nearest neighbors:

        - 'ball_tree' will use :class:`BallTree`
        - 'kd_tree' will use :class:`KDtree`
        - 'brute' will use a brute-force search.
        - 'auto' will attempt to decide the most appropriate algorithm
          based on the values passed to :meth:`fit` method.

        Note: fitting on sparse input will override the setting of
        this parameter, using brute force.

    leaf_size : int, optional (default = 30)
        Leaf size passed to BallTree or KDTree. This can affect the
        speed of the construction and query, as well as the memory
        required to store the tree. The optimal value depends on the
        nature of the problem.

    p: integer, optional (default = 2)
        Parameter for the Minkowski metric from
        sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances. When p = 1, this is
        equivalent to using manhattan_distance (l1), and euclidean_distance
        (l2) for p = 2. For arbitrary p, minkowski_distance (l_p) is used.

    metric : string or callable, default 'minkowski'
        metric to use for distance computation. Any metric from scikit-learn
        or scipy.spatial.distance can be used.

        If metric is a callable function, it is called on each
        pair of instances (rows) and the resulting value recorded. The callable
        should take two arrays as input and return one value indicating the
        distance between them. This works for Scipy's metrics, but is less
        efficient than passing the metric name as a string.

        Distance matrices are not supported.

        Valid values for metric are:

        - from scikit-learn: ['cityblock', 'cosine', 'euclidean', 'l1', 'l2',
          'manhattan']

        - from scipy.spatial.distance: ['braycurtis', 'canberra', 'chebyshev',
          'correlation', 'dice', 'hamming', 'jaccard', 'kulsinski',
          'mahalanobis', 'matching', 'minkowski', 'rogerstanimoto',
          'russellrao', 'seuclidean', 'sokalmichener', 'sokalsneath',
          'sqeuclidean', 'yule']

        See the documentation for scipy.spatial.distance for details on these
        metrics.

    metric_params : dict, optional (default = None)
        Additional keyword arguments for the metric function.

    contamination : float in (0., 0.5), optional (default=0.1)
        The amount of contamination of the data set, i.e. the proportion
        of outliers in the data set. When fitting it is used to define the
        threshold on the decision function.

    n_jobs : int, optional (default = 1)
        The number of parallel jobs to run for neighbors search.
        If ``-1``, then the number of jobs is set to the number of CPU cores.
        Affects only :meth:`k_neighbors` and :meth:`kneighbors_graph` methods.

        """Predict Local Outlier Factor of X.

        The local outlier factor (LOF) of a sample captures its
        supposed `degree of abnormality'.
        It is the average of the ratio of the local reachability density of
        a sample and those of its k-nearest neighbors.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : array-like, shape (n_samples, n_features), default=None
            The query sample or samples to compute the Local Outlier Factor
            wrt to the training samples. If None, makes prediction on the
            training data without considering them as their own neighbors.

        Returns
        -------
        is_inlier : array of shape (n_samples,)
            Returns 1 for anomalies/outliers and -1 for inliers.
